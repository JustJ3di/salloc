Simple pool memory allocator for embedded system.

This project provides a minimal implementation of a static memory pool allocator in C.
It allows allocation and release of fixed-size memory blocks from a pre-allocated pool, without relying on malloc() or the system heap.

The allocator is suitable for embedded systems, real-time applications, or performance-critical code where predictable allocation is required.
